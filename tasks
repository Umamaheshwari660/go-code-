Design and implement a console-based banking system in Go that models real-world banking operations using structs and methods only.
The system must simulate account management, transactions, and basic banking rules without using slices, maps, arrays, or databases.



🧱 Core Entities (Design Requirement)

1️⃣ Customer

Each customer represents a real bank user.

Fields (example-level guidance, not mandatory):
	•	CustomerID
	•	FullName
	•	Age
	•	PhoneNumber
	•	IsActive

Rules:
	•	Customer must be 18+
	•	Inactive customers cannot perform transactions

⸻

2️⃣ BankAccount

Each customer owns exactly one bank account.

Fields:
	•	AccountNumber
	•	AccountType (Savings / Current)
	•	Balance
	•	IsFrozen

Rules:
	•	Minimum balance:
	•	Savings: ₹1,000
	•	Current: ₹5,000
	•	Frozen accounts cannot:
	•	Withdraw
	•	Transfer
	•	Balance must never go negative

⸻

3️⃣ Bank

Represents the bank itself.

Fields:
	•	BankName
	•	IFSCCode
	•	TotalFunds
	•	Fixed number of customers (example: exactly 3 customers as struct fields)

⚠️ Since slices/maps are not allowed, customers must be stored like:
	•	Customer1
	•	Customer2
	•	Customer3

⸻

4️⃣ Transaction

Each transaction records a single operation.

Fields:
	•	TransactionID
	•	AccountNumber
	•	TransactionType (Deposit / Withdraw / Transfer)
	•	Amount
	•	Status (Success / Failed)

⚠️ Only the last transaction needs to be stored per account.

⸻

⚙️ Required Operations (Methods)

Customer-Level Methods
	•	ActivateCustomer()
	•	DeactivateCustomer()
	•	IsEligibleForBanking()

⸻

Account-Level Methods
	•	Deposit(amount)
	•	Withdraw(amount)
	•	GetBalance()
	•	FreezeAccount()
	•	UnfreezeAccount()

Validation must include:
	•	Account status
	•	Customer status
	•	Minimum balance rule

⸻

Bank-Level Methods
	•	OpenAccount(customer)
	•	CloseAccount(accountNumber)
	•	TransferFunds(fromAccount, toAccount, amount)
	•	GetBankTotalFunds()

⸻

Transaction-Level Methods
	•	CreateTransaction()
	•	MarkSuccess()
	•	MarkFailed(reason)

⸻

🔁 Application Flow (Simulation)
	1.	Create a Bank instance
	2.	Create fixed number of customers
	3.	Open accounts for customers
	4.	Perform:
	•	Deposits
	•	Withdrawals
	•	Transfers
	5.	Freeze one account and show failure cases
	6.	Deactivate one customer and block transactions
	7.	Print:
	•	Account balances
	•	Last transaction status
	•	Bank total funds

⸻

❗ Error Handling Rules
	•	Withdrawal more than balance → ❌ fail
	•	Transfer from frozen account → ❌ fail
	•	Deposit into closed account → ❌ fail
	•	Underage customer → ❌ fail
	•	Minimum balance violation → ❌ fail

Each failure must:
	•	Create a failed transaction
	•	Print a clear reason
